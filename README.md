After turning up empty handed for a tool to extract the .cat/.dat files, I wrote a quick Python script to extract the data.

Feel free to improve upon this script. To use it, just chuck it into the X Rebirth directory (the one that contains all of the .cat and .dat files), and run it. It will create a new directory called 'out', which will contain all of the extracted assets in their original directory structure.
